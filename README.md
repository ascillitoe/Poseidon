# Poseidon

This is a (very) basic prototype for a high order structured CFD code built on top of the [OPS](https://github.com/OP-DSL/OPS) parallelisation library. It is no longer under active development.

## Notes
Compiler and lib locations are currently set in libs/OPS/scripts/source_intellaptop.
